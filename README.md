# HOW TO RUN:
    code is designed to be run in conjunction with login, could be another use outside of login but re-writing would have to be done. 
    This can be run using pip install requirements 
    followed by python3 bloomFilter.py within the bloom directory. Note that while bloom filter is secure the 
    HTTP server hosting this is NOT.
